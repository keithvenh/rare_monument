Go into your github account, in the top right corner, click on your profile, then settings from the drop down menu

Choose SSH and GPG keys from the left panel

Click New SSH key button at the top

In the large Key box, press ctrl+v to past your ssh key 

Click the add SSH key button (you may be prompted to enter your github password)

Your computer should be fully set up to use git.

In the search bar, type rare_monument to get to the repository for the tutorials and game, click to open the repository, and on the left side, there is a clone or download button. Click it, make sure clone iwth SSH is selected, and copy the git@github text by clicking the clipboard button next to it.

back in your terminal, create a directory for your repsotories by typing mkdir Documents/repos/

change into this directory by typing cd Documents/repos/

type git clone and then press ctrl+shift+v to paste the address, then press enter 

You will likely get this response:

Looking good. Now, to open the repository for editing type code .

this will pop open a new VS Code window with all the files accessible for the rare_monument repository. You now have great power, lets teach you great responsibility next.

## ===== HOW TO GET TEXT TO ALWAYS WRAP IN VS Code ===== ##

In VS Code go to file>preferences>settings.

In the right box that pops up, you will see USER SETTINGS. between the curly braces, create a new line and type:
