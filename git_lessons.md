## Git Lessons

### Lesson 1 | VS Code Integrated Terminal and Git setup

- [ ] Open VS Code
- [ ] Type ``` `` ctrl+` `` # This should cause a terminal to open at the bottom of your screen ```
- [ ] In the terminal type ``` git --version # git version 2.7.4 ```
- [ ] Type ``` git config --global user.name "Your Name" ```
- [ ] Type ``` git config --global user.email your.email@example.com ```
- [ ] Now type ``` git status ```

With ``` git status ``` you should get a response like:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
```

Congratulations! Git is set up and ready to track any changes made to this directory. Now we just need to learn how to properly switch to a different branch, make changes and additions, save the changes and merge the branch back into the master branch.
