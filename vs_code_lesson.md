# A Rare Monument

A Text Adventure Game by the VH Bros

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code or VS Code or simple Code for short is in its most basic form a simple text editor. It is like notepad, only much more powerful and extensive. It is great for programming, because it uses syntax highlighting to color different elements in your code. For example, it will color variables, strings and integers differently. This aids in the readability of your code. In many ways it looks like this:

```javascript
 1 var my_string = "This is a string";
 2
 3 var my_integer = 2;
 4
 5 var my_array = ["This is a string", 2];
```

Handy. In addition VS Code comes equipped with a number of other great features, like code completion, debugging, built in git commands (which we will learn about soon), search features and a built in terminal. Making it an ideal developers environment. Still aren't convinced? Check out their [home page](https://code.visualstudio.com) for more.
