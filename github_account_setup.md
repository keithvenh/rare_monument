# A Rare Monument

## GitHub Account Setup

GitHub is an invaluable resource for any developer and programmer. It is where all this magic is hosted. It is a place for people to host the code repositories (a term we will explore later), and collaborate with other programmers. It is both free and easy to use, so lets get you set up with an account.

First, visit the [GitHub Home Page](https://github.com/).

Once there, you will see a standard sign-up form asking for a username, an email address and a password. Be sure to choose a username that is both easy to remember and easy to type as you may be needing to type it regularly when using git.

Once you create your account, you will be asked to select your plan. Here you just need to leave the "Unlimited public repositories for free" plan checked, then click "Continue" at the bottom.

Next, you'll be asked to answer a couple questions. Your answers will likely be "Totally new to programming", "Design, Project Management, Developement" and "I'm a hobbyist". Under what are you interested in, I would recommend typing, "tutorials, html, css, scss, javascript, jquery, web-development", but you can leave it blank if you want. When finished click the "Submit" button.

Congratulations! You have created a GitHub Account! In the top right corner of your screen you can edit settings to your profile, set a picture, etc. Feel free to use this whenever you like. If you want a tour of GitHub, you can click "Read the guide" in the middle of the screen. 

If you want to see the repository where this tutorial is hosted, type "rare_monument" in the search bar, and the result should be "keithvenh/rare_monument". Click on that to open up the repository where these tutorials, and eventually the text adventure game will be hosted.
